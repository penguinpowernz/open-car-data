open-car-data
=============

Information on cars produced in Japan presented in a json format.  Thanks to [http://english.auto.vl.ru](http://english.auto.vl.ru).

I'm scared to loose the useful and convenient data on vehicles I own from the great site listed above.  I thought I would make a mirror of the data in an open format that could be re-used and mashed up for use in other projects. I intend to teach myself ember.js by making an app to present this data.
